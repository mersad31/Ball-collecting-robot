## Introduction

The Ball Collecting Robot is designed to autonomously detect, locate, and collect balls in its surroundings using computer vision and robotic manipulation. The robot utilizes a combination of hardware components, such as a camera, microcontroller, motors, and gripper mechanism, along with software algorithms for ball detection, localization, and control.

This project serves as an educational resource for learning about computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems.

## Features

- Ball detection: The robot can detect balls in its field of view using computer vision techniques.
- Localization: The robot can estimate the position and distance of the detected balls.
- Navigation: The robot can navigate its environment autonomously while avoiding obstacles.
- Ball collection: The robot is equipped with a gripper mechanism to collect the detected balls.

## Hardware Requirements

To build the Ball Collecting Robot, you will need the following hardware components:

- Raspberry Pi Zero
- Camera module compatible with the microcontroller
- Motor controller with L293D IC
- Gripper mechanism for ball collection
- Ultra sonic distance meter sensor
- Robot chassis and wheels
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- power

## Software Dependencies

The Ball Collecting Robot project relies on the following software dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi)
- Additional libraries for motor control, image processing, and navigation (based on your chosen framework)

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the project.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the Ball Collecting Robot project:
